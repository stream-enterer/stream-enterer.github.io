About Marijuana Anonymous
=========================

Marijuana Anonymous is a fellowship of people sharing experience, strength, and hope with each other that we may solve our common problem and help others to recover from marijuana addiction.

The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using marijuana. There are no dues or fees for membership. We are self supporting through our own contributions. MA is not affiliated with any religious or secular institution or organization and has no opinion on any outside controversies or causes. Our primary purpose is to stay free of marijuana and to help the marijuana addict who still suffers achieve the same freedom. We can do this by practicing our suggested twelve steps of recovery and by being guided as a group by our twelve traditions.

[Marijuana Anonymous](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org) uses the basic [12 Steps](https://www.madistrict6.org/twelve-steps-of-marijuana-anonymous) of Recovery founded by Alcoholics Anonymous, because it has been proven that the 12 Step Recovery program works!
